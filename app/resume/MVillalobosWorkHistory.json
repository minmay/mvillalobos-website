      "prologue": "I developed software components for land-based table and cabinet regulated gaming systems. These were closed systems, with touch screens, bill validators, printers, that must interface with casinos via the Slot Accounting System (SAS) protocol.",
      "accomplishments": [
        "Provided architectural guidance in the development of RESTful systems that used Java, JDK 1.8, Spring Boot, Maven, thread-safe domain objects, data-access objects, services, dependency injection, transaction management with AOP, JAX-RS with Jersey, JSON serialization with Jackson, JDBC, unit testing, integration testing, Docker, Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.",
        "Implemented a command-line tool with Java and Git that analyzed a Maven project and checkout all of its dependencies within the organization in the order that they must be built or tagged. This project leveraged Maven Aether and JGIt libraries. This essentially was a graphing problem that required a combination of Breadth First Traversal and Depth First Traversal.",
        "Solved many of the concurrency problems that were required for a functional product. I also used this opportunity to mentor the staff on good concurrency practices.",
        "Introduced and setup the Flyway database migration tool to provide organization to how we manage our database schema."

This task used JRuby, Java threads, Java Concurrency, JDBC batch, Badger, and AWS.",
        "I implemented an internal Ruby GEM that we called \"Badger\" that simplified the task of writing high-performance JDBC Batch scripts for Ruby developers. I demonstrated on an application that took 18 hours to complete with Active Record only took 15 minutes with this library."
