	<h2>Me <small>as a Developer</small></h2>
	<div>
		<p>I program on a Mac. I use IntelliJ. I save my stuff with Git. I deploy to Linux. I'll make a distributed system work on Docker. I prefer to use Java for implementing services and complex systems.
		My favorite database is PostgreSQL. NoSQL or Big Data? No problem, I can write to Cassandra, HBase, Amazon Dynamo.
		I think its a waste of time to write a database driven form based web application in Java because
		that can be done so much more easily with Ruby on Rails. If I quickly need to write a script that will
		be used once, I prefer Ruby since it supports scripting, object-oriented programming, has a REPL, does not need compilation, regular expressions are designed
		into the language syntax, and it has "here" docs. I can even make it run faster with JRuby. However, if I need to make an application perform, implement complex large system,
		or must implement a RESTful API, then I prefer Java for those types of problems.</p>
		<p>I wrote this website in less than a week, and I picked up Angular2 and TypeScript along the way.</p>
		<p>On a team, I am quite often the person that somebody turns to when they need to solve a concurrency, database design, or maven problem.</p>
		<p>I love Ad Technology, and I developed my own performance Ad Server, ask me about it. I love to talk about it.</p>

		<p>I wrote this website. I wanted a website with a responsive design that
			separated the content of my resume from the actual display markup. Angular was the perfect choice for
			separating content from the display markup. In fact, my resume is available in the JSON format that drives
			this website. I achieved responsiveness by using Bootstrap.</p>
