      "prologue": "I develop software for casino gaming systems (Las Vegas). These are skill-based casino video games with touch screens, bill validators, printers, that must interface with casinos via the Slot Accounting System (SAS) protocol. My role was software architecture, hands-on development, mentoring, and technical leadership.",
      "accomplishments": [
        "Architecture and development of RESTful APIs with Java, JDK 1.8, and Spring Boot. I designed our layered-architecture, package structure, and build. Developed and mentored staff with the practice of concurrency programming, domain driven design, and the Spring Framework. These projects used services, dependency injection, transaction management with AOP, JAX-RS with Jersey, JSON serialization with Jackson, JDBC, unit testing, integration testing, Docker, Docker Compose, Flyway database migrations, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.",
        "Implemented a streaming data statistical calculator that could test for randomness with the Runs Test, and Autocorrelation Test. It accepted unlimited size datasets with any range of numbers. Input files were over 10 GB. Statistical models were designed with only academic research papers as reference.",
        "Implemented high-performance, low-latency TCP/IP applications with Java 8, NIO and Netty. I designed and implemented our TCP/IP application layer protocols.",
        "Implemented a command-line tool with Java and Git that analyzed a Maven project and checked out all of its dependencies within the organization in the order that they must be built or tagged. This project used Maven Aether and JGIt libraries. This essentially was a graphing problem that required a combination of breadth first traversal and depth first traversal.",
        "Architecture and development of a full-stack system. Delivered complete software architecture with Attribute Driven Design methodology (ADD 3.0). From the top, UI was written with Angular 6 and Bootstrap. RESTful API was written with Python 2, Flask, and SQL Alchemy. OAuth 2 Authorization server was written with Python 2, Flask, Authlib, Open LDAP, and SQL Alchemy."

My role was software architecture, hands-on development, mentoring, and technical leadership.",
      "accomplishments": [
        "I developed database migration scripts to provide referential integrity and auditing functionality to a production PostgreSQL database. These migrations also fixed data anomalies.",
        "I developed high-performance multi-threaded ETL data-pipeline that transferred 900,000 records, persisted 7 million database records, and uploaded 3.5 million files that accounted for 73.3 GB in S3. This task used JRuby, Java threads, Java Concurrency, JDBC batch, Badger, and AWS.",
